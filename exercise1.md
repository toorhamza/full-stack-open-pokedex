I chose Swift lanuage which is the main language for Apple software developers. The pipelines mostly involve testing the code and following the linting guidelines. After that the deployment is done.

There are a lot of CI/CD tools for multiple languages. The most popular ones are Circle CI, Travis CI and if you are hosting on cloud like AWS then you can use cloud native services like Cloud formation etc.

It depends on the requirements but I would prefer a cloud hosted CI solution rather than self-hosted one as self-hosted systems become too complicated and required extra labor to maintain it.
